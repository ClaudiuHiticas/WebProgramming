Write a web application in PHP/JSP/ASP.NET which uses the following 2
database tables:
- table Users: id (int), username (string), password (string)
- table Assets: id (int), userid (int), name (string), description (string), value (int)

The user should authenticate prior to using the application. After the
user is succesfully authenticated, a web page with all the assets belonging
to that user will be displayed. The assets that have a value higher than 10
should be displayed with red background color. 
The user then should be able to add 1 or many assets (using one single 
HTTP Request) using Ajax and Json HTTP requests.

Grading scale:
- 1 point by default (oficiu)
- configure web environment, create DB, authentication              : 2
- show all assets of the user; red color assets with value > 10     : 3
- add 1 or many assets using Ajax and Json   	                    : 4
  (javascript code for adding many assets + server-side code)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obs: The server-side technology (PHP or JSP or ASP.NET) is not at your
choice, it will be fixed by the exam subject. However, you can change
this technology to another one of your preference, but in this case
the final grade that you receive will be cut at 6 (i.e. the maximum
grade that you can get for this practical exam is 6).
